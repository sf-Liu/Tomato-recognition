# Tomato-recognition
This is the final big assignment I did in the pattern recognition course. 
The main purpose of this program is to identify individual tomato plants, and measure some of its figure data.
Now that the time has passed for nearly a year, I uploaded this program to github. 
If the professor will also arrange the same assignments for my schoolmates, I hope that they will not copy, 
And please mark the source of the code when referring to some of my code.
